        <p>I have worked at a street pineapple stall for almost 4 years. It all started since I was 16 to 17 at weekly morning market. I often sell to the teachers as well as the school staff during school days. Sometimes, we also bought fruits from our trusted business contacts of the industry, as our farms produces is in stages for we wanted to assure the customers of our products quality remain the same.

            Business doesn't always flow smoothly. However to gain customers trust in our product, we must recommend the best items especially so in this industry where a lot of people started to realize how much money they can gain from this industry. In a short period of time, our business gain quite a lot of regular customers as well as from others recommendation. Our promotion strategies are mainly by giving people the taste test besides online promotion for them to evaluate the quality whether its worth buying or not.

            Here's some tips to identify some rotten pineapple. If the pineapple stem is black,  the possibility of the pineapple's core turn to rotten are 90%. The pineapple with blackken stem usually doesn't last long. For normal pineapple farmers this is just some occasional cases that do not have much impact on the business. However if their farm produces almost all blackken stems pineapple then there is something wrong with their fertilizer. This case has once occured to a new farmer who taught nothing could go wrong without early tested their cultivation. Perhaps they could learn from their first mistakes. Pineaapple is a costly business. One can gain losses and profit. That is why a lot must be learn before starting it as everything needs knowledge.

        <p>Pineapple have many varient. Among them, MD2 is the sweetest and the king of pineapple. My personal favourite however are the Yankee. The outer appearence befits its name, and the inner fill are light color. The taste are perfect for me as its sweetness feels young and original. Yankee perfect color to be pick is when its appearence still wholy dark. Our farm started with Sarawak and N36, and then started venture to MD2 widely as MD2 is the most sought after for it doesn't have the acidity that made it sour unless its a bad fruit like other pineapple. After few years we venture the Madu Kaca and Yankee.</p>
