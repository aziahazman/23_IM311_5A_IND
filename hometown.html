                        <h3>Hawskbill Turtle</h3>
                    
                        <p>Most tourist came to see the turtle in Terengganu. There are two enormous turtle stones (Batu Penyu), one of which is immersed in seawater and the other is hidden between bushes on a small hill in a settlement away from the coast, are thought to be the attraction for turtles, according to the locals. The legendary "Batu Penyu" turtle, which is said to be found in Bukit Che Hawa, Rantau Abang, is thought to be the turtle queen that lured the enormous leatherback dermochelys coriacea turtles to the beach at Rantau Abang every year from July to August to lay eggs. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                        Despite the Fisheries Department's conservation efforts, studies indicate a decline in the number of turtles returning each year to lay their eggs. A visitor's incorporative behaviour, such as yanking the turtle's flippers or riding on its back, has contributed to this in part.The nearly extinct leatherback turtles travelled as far as South America to lay their eggs. However, the whole population of turtles, including the Green Back and Hawksbill species that swim to our coasts, is impacted by brisk development and poaching, and attempts are being done to stem their declining population. The Rantau Abang Turtle Information Centre offers information on the many turtle species, and the turtle hatchlings can be seen on the beach across the street. And if you're fortunate, you'll get to see as young turtles are released into the water. </p>

                    <p>Kenyir Dam Historical event. There used to be a village at the bottom of Lake Kenyir, was once home to nine villages, including Kampung Melur, Kelitok, Berching, Petang, Mentong, Melaka, Kuala Terenggan, Kerbak, and Belimbing. The village was shifted into three main settlements, Kampung Melur, Kelitok, and Berching, with a total population of around 100 families. The village was connected by river and boat or raft as the main means of transportation, with an average of four people per family. The village's remote location and isolation from development made it difficult for residents to commute to Kuala Berang. In the 1950s, the state government decided to develop Lake Kenyir as a water catchment area and tourist attraction. Residents were asked to leave, although they received fair compensation to ensure their welfare.</p>

                 <p>The Kuala Terengganu Drawbridge spans the mouth of the Terengganu River in Kuala Terengganu, Terengganu, Malaysia. The bridge, which spans the river as the fourth in the Kuala Terengganu City region after Sultan Mahmud Bridge, Manir Bridge, and Pulau Sekati Bridge, was officially opened on August 1, 2019, and its design was influenced by London's Tower Bridge. The drawbridge crosses the mouth of the Terengganu River over a 638-meter-long, 23-meter-wide single-carriageway.It links Muara Utara (North Bank) in Seberang Takir with Muara Selatan (South Bank), a reclaimed land in the heart of Kuala Terengganu's city, close to Tanjung. When the double-leafed span is closed, it has a 12.5 metre clearance above the water. The drawbridge's clear span is 50 metres long. To view Terengganu people can get inside the bridge tower with entry ticket as low as Rm5 the last time I remember.</p>

                        <p>The oldest carvings and the first examples of Jawi writing in Malaysia may be discovered on the inscribed stone known as Batu Bersurat Terengganu, which is thought to be 700 years old. It is proof that Islam was practised in Terengganu prior to 1326 or 1386. The stone was found in Kampung Buluh, Kuala Berang, Hulu Terengganu, in 1887 following a flood on the banks of Sungai Tersat. Arab businessman Sayid Husin bin Ghulam al-Bokhari made the discovery after coming across the stone by chance following a flood. The stone attests to Terengganu's governmental recognition of Islam as a well-established religion. The Terengganu Stone Inscription is a documented legal code that attests to the existence of the Islamic legal order and serves as a repository for Islamic history in Malay historiography. The Jawi writing system, language, astronomy, and epigraphy are four aspects of the engraved stones that show they were influenced by Islam. The original Batu Bersurat are currently situated at Kuala Berang, Terengganu. The real Batu Bersurat are currently at Kuala Berang, Hulu Terengganu.</p>

There are more picnic location with waterfall, Chemerong Waterfall, Sekayu Waterfall, Langsir Waterfall, Tok Dor Waterfall, Puteri Waterfall, Tanggol Waterfall, Jenagor Waterfall, Lasir Waterfall, Saok Waterfall, Lata Kolam, Lata Belatan, Lata Tembakah and many others.
