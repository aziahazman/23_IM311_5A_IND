        <h3>Reading Novel</h3>

        <p>
            I enjoy reading probably since I was 12. Reading gave more knowledge and place us in different perspective in facing things. I don't usually read Malay books as I found that there's barely any worth to read book with good quality content. Malay authors nowdays often chose to follow the trend of what malaysian readers like. Sometimes it is good to follow the trend but mostly it isn't. Too much trend in reading makes it became cliche and boring as the scene outcome can already be expected without much progress to alleviated into smarter story. It feels like the story became more ridiculous on the verge of stupidity. I enjoy reading light novel nowdays.</p>

        <h3>Reading Comics and Manhwa</h3>

        <p>There are difference in artwork based on origin. The originals usually known as webtoon as the artist usually release their original work themselves thus webtoon is also a way for them to directly gain money. They are enjoyable reading, sometimes hilarious &#128518; .</p>

        <h3>Streaming</h3>

        <p> Animation aren't just cartoon. Anime aren't for kids. Anime really taught me a lot growing up. My first pull into anime world is when the Sword Art Online series first release and the NTV7 use to screened it at 9.00 a.m. every Saturday maybe around 2012 &#128517; and then I started gotten attracted to vampire ever since. </p>

        <h3>Watching Movies</h3>

        <p>I am stil just a normal human who enjoy movies. My interest are usually 70% action or science fiction. Teen movies doesn't feel exciting cause its too much teenange delusion of how the world revolves around them when its not. I do watch horror if you're wonder. But I still think that turkish horror are the one that gives true horror cause they're more of black magic and never fail to gives me goosebumps which means they act really well &#129311; . </p>

        <h3>Stroll</h3>
        <p>I certainly enjoy evening or morning stroll. Those are few sunset pictures taken from my stroll. I enjoy the neighbouring villages air as my house are close with the main road. I love that villages have abundant trees and not crowded and hectic. Its just my of finding peace from stressfull mind. Everyone needs stress relief on their own way. Sometimes I do ride on main road. I need experience on riding for me to better my skils and be more considerate of others. We need to see things in different perspectives as well + I get to see a lot of amazing ride out there and aspire me a lot. </p>
